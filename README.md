# Tolevskies Loyalty Program Mobile Application
An airline loyalty program mobile phone application made using the Ionic framework.
Completed for the University of Wollongong (UOW) CSIT214 (IT Project Management) Group Project assessment.

**Usage instructions:**

1. Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/current)
2. Install Ionic (https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/cli)
3. Clone/download the repository
4. In a terminal or command line, run "ionic serve" (without quotation marks) inside the project directory
5. Open the localhost URL in your preferred web-browser
6. You may need to switch to mobile-phone view mode in Inspect Element

**Functionality Not Added:**

1. Due to using Ionic Angular instead of other JS variants, without a database we cannot create, or change the details of, accounts
2. Want the footer buttons to be disabled when on the corresponding page. Not implemented as the ion-segment-buttons are overlapping each other and are clickable when a button is disabled.
3. Sometimes the footer does not correctly change its default value for each page. How painful! Will not fix :)
